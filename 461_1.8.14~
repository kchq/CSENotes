Network layer
	IP Layer
	   -Nodes on networks can be routers/workstations/etc
	   -At the IP layer, addresses for sending and recieving are IP addresses.
	   -IPv4 is an IP address.
	   -Must use IP addresses rather than just broadcasting everyhting that is sent out
	   -A prefix for the IP address is used such that every router that is set up knows
	   that it only have to keep trck of the direction of the IP networks with a given IPs'
	   
	   When putting data on the wire you need:
	   	-youself (source IP  address)
		-destination (dest IP address)
		-data


		||  DST-MAC |  SRC-MAC |  DST-IP |  SRC-IP |  DATA ||

		
		
	-Create IP header, send to the Link layer (where the entire data includes the IP header
	Link layer then attaches its MAC address (dest and source). 
	Send this stuff to the gateway, which then strips off the MAC headers
	Gateway discovers that it is IP, so it looks up in the router information 
	(forwarding table) how to send.
	Takes data you sent it, attaches new MAC addresses (source is now the routers, dst is 
	where it is going next.

	-Must avoid loops in your forwarding table. To avoid this, there is a TTL field in the 
	network layer
	
		|| DEST IP | SOURCE IP | TTL | DATA ||
