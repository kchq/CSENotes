Project 1: Registration
Building a protocol on top of UDP to regisiter a remote service

TCP vs UDP:
-TCP send first packet asking for if its cool to open communication
     -opens "flow" connection at the network level
     -overhead is associated with creating the actual connection

-UDP, spit packets with arbitrary IP to arbitrary destination without a secure connection
      -UDP unconnected, just send shit
      -lower latency for small amounts of data

----------------------------------------------
Project 2: Tor network (anonymization network)
-privacy of content, but lacks privacy of who you are talking to
-addresses of who you are trying to talk to are in the header, which is required to access information online.
-must send message to some other destination, in the case of Tor, we talk to some Tor node.

Using a node network, they cannot tell which request was sent to the node when. Cannot trace back to the initial request.

No single node know where your endpoint is headed. If you were trying to break the network, you would have to go from the endpoint, and work backwards
