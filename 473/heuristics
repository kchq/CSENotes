Heurisitics

Evaluation function f(n) for node N

f(N) = estimated total cost of path though n to goal
f(N) = g(N) + h(N)
     g(N) = cost so far
     h(N) cost from n to goal

fronteir is priority queue

Consistency of a Heuristic
h(n) is consistent if for every node n and every successor n' generated by an action:

h(n) <= c(n,a,n') + h(n')

Lamen's: After taking an action, the old estimate should be less than or equal to the new estimate + the actual cost. 

complete: yes
time: exponential (often faster)
space: exponential
optimal: yes
