State-Space Search Problems
general problem: find a path from a start state to a goal state:
	-goal test: tests if a given state is a goal state
	-successor function: given a state, evaluate successors states (next possible moves)

Variants: route planning, path independent search, etc

State Space: All possible states of our agent
Successor Function: function evaluated at a move to generate possible succesor states

Search Trees:
       root contains start state
       children = successor states
       edges = actions and step costs to lead to those new actions
       path from root to node is a "plan" to get to that state
