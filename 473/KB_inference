KB: knowledge base, set of sentences represented in a knowledge representation language
    -stores assertions about the world

Inference: When you ask the KB a question, answer should follow what has been tell'ed to the kb previously

What is a logic?
     syntax: what expressions are legal
     semantics: what legal expression evalute to

Entailment:
	KB
	sentance a

	KB entails a if and only if a is true in all worlds (models)where KB is true

	EXAMPLE: m is a model of a sentence "a" if "a" is true in "m"

	M(a) is set of all models of a

	KB entials a iff M(KB) is a subset of M(a)

Soundness:
	if an inference algorithm only derives entailed sentence, it is called sound

Completeness: 
	      an algorithm is complete if it can derive any sentence that is entailed
