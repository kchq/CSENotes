Properties of Environments

Observability: Full vs partial: input all aspects of environment, or a subset?
Deterministic vs stochastic: Is next move entirely based on current state, is there a probability of an unexpected action
Episodic vs Sequential: Is next move indenpendent of last move
Discrete vs continuous: When are evaluations of state being made?
