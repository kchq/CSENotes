-regular expressions by default concatenated with an epsilon transition
-between every state we must add an epsilon transition (why?)
	 -this causes it to become non-deterministic

-Must change from ND to deterministic:
      -must take all possible paths with free epsilon transitions

k states to 2^k states in deterministic state machine (worst case scenario)
(exponential complexity)
