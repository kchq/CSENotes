compile time:
	Lexer/Tokenizer		:irregular expressions, includes?, operating sys interaction, etc
	parser			:grammar
	analyzer		:has to look at large parts of the program to make sense of typing,etc

	redundancy eliminator	
	resource allocator	
	code generator		

runtime:
	generation of the actual code


-Compiler can make choices, it can either try to compute things statically, or dynamicaly do it at runtime
-If compiler cant figure out how to evaluate and execute the program, the compiler must generate code such that at runtime, it can be executed.
-Runtime system, runtime libraries, as well as compiler generated code
	 -if compiler cant evaluate some library function, it waits until runtime library rutine.
